# cevi
This repository includes a body of scripts and data used to estimate our proposed Climate Extreme Vulnerability Index (CEVI). Estimation is based on the Alkire-Foster method (Alkire and Foster, 2011), combined with a newly proposed method on forward variance for the identification of the multidimensional deprivation cutoff.

# Repository content
In this respository you will find the following material:
* Script for the estimation of the CEVI index (**Final Script.R**);
* Script for the production of radar charts (**Radar Charts.R**)
* Script for the production of dimensional decompositions (**Barplot with Multi Legend.R**)
* Script for unidimensional cutoffs (**Cutoffs.R**)
* Script for the optimal identification of multidimensional cutoffs (sensitivity and dominance analysis) (**CEVI Functions.R**)
* Data on health, socioeconomic, infrastructure, and climate extreme variables (**CEVI data.RData**)
