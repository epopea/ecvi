# cevi
This repository includes a body of scripts and data used to estimate our proposed Climate Extreme Vulnerability Index (CEVI). Estimation is based on the Alkire-Foster method (Alkire and Foster, 2011), combined with a newly proposed method on forward variance for the identification of the multidimensional deprivation cutoff.

# Repository content
In this respository you will find the following material:
* Script for the estimation of the CEVI index (<tt>Final Script.R</tt>);
* Script for the production of radar charts (<tt>Radar Charts.R</tt>)
* Script for the production of dimensional decompositions (<tt>Barplot with Multi Legend.R</tt>)
* Script for unidimensional cutoffs (<tt>Cutoffs.R</tt>)
* Script for the optimal identification of multidimensional cutoffs (sensitivity and dominance analysis) (<tt>CEVI Functions.R</tt>)
* Data on health, socioeconomic, infrastructure, and climate extreme variables (<tt>CEVI data.RData</tt>)
